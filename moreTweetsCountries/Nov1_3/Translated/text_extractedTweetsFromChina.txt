On Monday morning, the landlord to Tucao look good. The following is a conversation we were this morning:
Landlord: "wear two on the line, the minimum temperature was twenty-three degrees today."
I thought he was not cold, then retorted: "Well twenty-three degree has been very cold."
Host: "The cold ah."
Dead language I did not understand, said earlier this syntax.
"Only twenty-three degrees, cold ah."
Not dealing well with the fact that it's Monday.
